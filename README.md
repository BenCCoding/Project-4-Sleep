# The Sleep Tracker App:
* This app is a collection of sleep. The intention for the app is made with the reminder throughout my course that everyone hasn't slept peacefully while worrying what could go wrong the next day. The app is just a way to try and keep a track of your days, like when working so hard that Monday becomes Friday within a day and you can't recall what you did for the week.
* Essentially, The Sleep Tracker a list of posts made by people who want to share how they slept. 
* The User can sign up for the sleep tracker and will be greeted with the 5 required field to make your account. The Username, email, password, confirmation and your profile picture you can post if you want.

* When logged in you will be greeted with the 5 requirements to post your own sleeping note while also being able to see any other posts made by everone else that is on the app.

* **Add Post Information**, The 4 input fields can be filled out however you want since the App
is built off of what you put into the website with your account. They can be summed up to the date you posted, when you went to bed, how long did you sleep for, and you can add what you felt like this morning.
* **Photo**, Now you could post where you slept whether it could be outside or you could post something else to give your post some flair.
* **Profile Account**, On the top left is your profile picture that can be clicked to view your own posts instead of having to scroll through the main feed if you want to remember what was your post. You can then press the house picture on the top right to return to the main posting page.
